So to do the expected, I need to talk about the VPN service that I use personally. [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net). I have been using Mullvad for over 5 years now and it has served me well since I primarily use Wireguard which they support.

Mullvad does NOT have an affiliate program, so there is no way I can be monetarily incentivized to promote their product. This is just the one I trust and use daily.

Key Features I appreciate:

	- Anonymous Account: You can pay in crypto and don't require an e-mail address to register
	- No Logging: Any company can say this but Mullvad has [examples](https://www.techradar.com/news/mullvads-no-log-policy-proven-after-police-raid)
	- Based in Sweden: Better than the US!
	- Regular Audits: Mullvad regularly [audits](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/audits) their software
	- Built in kill switch
	- Easy to use I have set other non-technical users up with the service and they can manage themselves after that
	- Large list of global servers that change and are updated regularly

It does what I want and is priced extremely reasonably!
